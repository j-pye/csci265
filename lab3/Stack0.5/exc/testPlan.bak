Test Plan for exception.pm
Peter Walsh Oct 2012

The tb.cew script contains test cases that are expected to fail.
The intent is to verify that cew handels the presence and absence of
exceptions in the appropriate way.

Make bats is expected to produce:

Test Case ERROR (Ncase) in script at line number 44
Unexpected Exception full thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 50
Unexpected exception ull thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 51
Unexpected exception full thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 54
Expected exception full not thrown 

**********Summary**********
Total number of test cases = 6
Total number of test cases in error = 4
